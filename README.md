## About

Recipe Runner is a database management website for a (hypothetical)
application that stores thousands of recipes into a database. Clients
can select recipes that they would like to cook for the week, and 
the app makes grocery shopping easier by creating a grocery list out of 
their collection of recipes. 


## The Website

The Recipe Runner website is intended to be the administrative aspect 
of the application. On the website, you can manage client information,
the recipes they select, available recipes, and available ingredients. 

The website also contains a demo page to demonstrate Recipe Runner's
main function: constructing a grocery list out of a clients' list of 
chosen recipes. 

## Database Design
